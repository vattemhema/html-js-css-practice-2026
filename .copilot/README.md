# Copilot Settings (Repo Notes)

This folder contains **project-specific guidance** for using GitHub Copilot in this repository.

- GitHub Copilot on GitHub (and many tools) will also read instructions from:
  - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

## What’s in here

- `settings.json`: Lightweight, human-readable project preferences (simple HTML/CSS/JS, no frameworks).

## Recommended prompts

- "Create a small HTML/CSS practice page for Day X with semantic tags and responsive layout."
- "Add a vanilla JS interaction (button click, toggle class) with clean DOM selection and no globals."
- "Improve accessibility: labels, landmarks, focus styles, and contrast."
