# Copilot Instructions (Repository)

This repository is for learning and practicing **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## Goals

- Keep solutions beginner-friendly and easy to read.
- Prefer small, focused examples over large rewrites.
- Preserve the existing folder structure under `src/`.

## Tech Constraints

- Use **vanilla HTML/CSS/JS** (no frameworks unless explicitly requested).
- Avoid adding build tooling (Webpack/Vite/React) unless asked.
- Prefer working within existing `index.html` files for each day.

## Code Style

- Use semantic HTML: `header`, `main`, `section`, `nav`, `footer` where appropriate.
- Keep CSS organized (group related rules, use CSS variables for colors when helpful).
- In JS, avoid global variables; prefer `const`/`let`, and wrap code in an IIFE or use `type="module"` when adding scripts.
- Add accessibility basics: labels for inputs, alt text for meaningful images, visible focus styles.

## When Editing

- Make minimal, targeted changes.
- If you add new files, keep them next to the day’s `index.html` (or in a clear subfolder) and reference them with relative paths.
